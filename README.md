# 🚀 Matrix Multiplier — Advanced Python Project

Welcome to **Matrix Multiplier**, an advanced CPU-based matrix multiplication engine written in pure Python and NumPy.

This is my **first serious programming project**, aimed at exploring matrix operations and performance benchmarking. Built with love, curiosity, and the help of ChatGPT 🤖.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ **Pure Python Implementation**  
- ⚡ **NumPy Optimized Version**  
- 🧪 **Benchmarking Framework**  
- 📊 Compare performance of basic vs optimized  
- ✅ Clean, modular code ready for future upgrades

---

## 💻 How It Works

The project implements two matrix multiplication methods:

1. **Pure Python**: Uses nested loops  
2. **NumPy**: Uses `numpy.dot()` for ultra-fast execution

Then, it benchmarks both using matrices of various sizes.
